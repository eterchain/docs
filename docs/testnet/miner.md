# Eterchain Client

Let's get you set up and ready to operate efficiently on the blockchain network, You can view all versions of [eClient Releases](https://github.com/eterchain/eterminer/releases).

```
### Step 2 : Extract the File
```mdx title="After the download is complete, extract the file"
tar -xvzf eterchainV1.0.2.tar.gz
```
### Step 3 : Enter the Extracted Folder
```mdx title="Navigate to the extracted folder"
cd eterchain
```
### Step 4 : Run the eClient
```mdx title="Run the eClient with the following command"
./eterminer
```
### Step 5 : Enter Your EVM Wallet Address
```mdx title="Provide your EVM wallet address"
